## Rotosolve
For each parameter, use the provided equation (1) for the closed form solution requiring 3 evaluations of the quantum circuit

## Rotoselect
For each parameter, try every gate from a selection of generators G, and pick the one that minimizes the function. Abstract away a 'layer' as any possible from a set of gates. I think there's definitely a way to think about this which is a little cleverer.
