# Initialisation
----
* Dependent upon understanding the cost landscape
* Major issue is with random initialisation of complex parameters (phasors) is that if you integrate them they cancel. This has the exact same problem as random rotations. 

1. Heuristics | The heuristics are better than random, but not quite there.
2. Meta-learning | This seems to be a particularly effective approach
