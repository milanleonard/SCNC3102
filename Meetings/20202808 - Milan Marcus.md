## Quantum brilliance side of things
- New office is towards the colleges of the big shiny ball.
- We should **contact Matthew Janes and Ian Peterson**. Engineers -> Quantum physics. 
- Had David Garvin - Head of Quant Finance at CBA and went and worked for QBranch. The right person for talking to about Quantum algorithm applications. Mathematician, research oriented.
- Haven't heard back from Michael. Hypothesis: internal stuff going on in DSTG about quantum, wait and see.
- **Trellis is doing a field demo for the army on speech analysis stuff. Come along and have a toy demo for how quantum computing could help.**
  - Come up with some idea for this
