# Shot noise on more complicated

## Adopt a noise model
Look at how the optimizers deal with different noise models

* One metric, how many steps did it take to converge
* Key message about gradient descent\
* Assymetric initialisation and readout errors, more likely to get a false zero than a false one.

Simplest error is a symmetric readout error, zero mean. Then an assymetric readout error, depolarizing error, with shots?

Let's hope everything goes bad under asymmetric noise
