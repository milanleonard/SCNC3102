# Weekly meeting 2
----
Pre-objective: Do an initial survey of quantum optimization and initialisation.
## QB related
Meeting with Trellis tomorrow. Aware of what's evolving there, part of the idea of coming and working more of QB. 

## Kalman filtering
For algorithms where it's simple optimization. Something which is sensitive, something which is small won't give greater performance. Conjecturate at the moment. 

## Next steps
Options
1. Runs on the board, get a practical feeling by implementing different optimizers for a simple case.
2. Invest more time in reading and surveying things at this stage. 
3. One of them is ansatz classification.
   1. Find a mapping between a generator and a vector subspace. 

Susceptibility to noise
Iterations to acceptable tolerance
Noise probability, equal probability of pauli gates happening randomly in your circuit.
