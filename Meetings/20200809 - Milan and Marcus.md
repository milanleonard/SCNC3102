# Optimization
----
## Hyperparameter tuning
Think about 

## Marcus
Interested to see if noise destroys the gradient calculations. Shot noise stuff for next week

## Next steps
Sample noise

## Data encoding
### One step
One qubit gate on each gate, 
- Pairing problem - stable marriage problem. 
- moments of a statistical distribution
- Very interested in exploring this with the stable marriage problem
### Two step encoding
Can go from a linear n encoding + calculation to n^2 encoding calculation - two step encoding

## Ising models
Ising model used to approximate binary approximation of optimization problems 

## Quantum Brilliance
Meeting with trellis next week, floated the idea in involving QB with defence force in Nov and Feb.
